After reading James Clear's book "Atomic Habits" I was inspired to build better habits and break out of bad ones. In fact, I was super excited about this because I could use my programming skills to create program to track my habits while at the same time building my programming skills which was one of the habits I wanted to work on in the first place!

I used this program as 'habit tracker' to see how well I was perfomring each of my existing and new habits.   "The chain on continuity"   As Benjamin Franklin would say, "Lose no time. Be always employed in something useful" 

Tracking my habits with this program allowed me to adavance on other points in Clear's book like habit stacking, designing and priming my envirnment based on the days or specific time of day I objectively struggle with certain habits.
