# Dalies

After reading James Clear's book "Atomic Habits" I was inspired to build better habits and break out of bad ones. I'm (past or present tense?) super excited about this project because I could develop my coding skills (a habit I already want build) while creating a habit tracking program to work on building even more positive habits! 

My 'Dalies' habit building program helped me work on key foundations from Clear's book such as habit stacking, establishing a chain of continuity, and designing/priming my environment based on the days or specific time of day I objectively struggle (present tense) with certain habits.    

As I started successfully performing desired habits (like coding, reading, and working out) more and more checkmarks built up on my whiteboard and lines of best fit trended upward I began to establish a chain of continuity that motivated me to coninue on and not break the streak! Having all my habits listed out in a singular place (and in order of when I should complete them throughout a given day) helped me stack habits together. That way when I went into the bathroom to brush my teeth I wasn't just doing that but pairing it with flossing and mouthwash utilzing the principals of classical conditioning (specifcally higher order conditioning). *Idk if I need to go into an example on designing/priming envirnment since I already did that above.
